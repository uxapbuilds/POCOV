# POCO - V (Volunteer) : An App Built to Report & Control Pollution.
- Android App built for common civillian's to report various kind of pollutions. iOS(Coming Soon). 
---
# Features
##### 1. Add Complaint 
- Users can add a new complaint in matter of minutes.
- Air, Water, Noise & Land are some of the common types of pollution available to fill for.
- To avoid multiple fake complaints, OTP verification is added. 

##### 3. My Complaints
- Adding a complaint isn't enough, once the user adds a complaint he/she will look for progress. Like is it done? What is the status?
- For this, a **My Complaints** section is added to show all the complaints added so far by the user with info of status, completion date & the area officer that is to be or has been assigned to respective complaint. 

##### 3. Dashboard
- Insights are what will encourage someone to take on the mantle of volunteer to help clean the his/her surroundings by filling as many comlaints possible.
- **7 Day Stats** : Gives insight on the amount of complaints that have been filed in the last 7 days.
- **Overall, In Process & Completed** : Tells the amount of complaints in their respective domains. 

##### 4. FAQ
- We can't leave users with just some app, their will be times when a user would get confused about one or two things about the app.
- We have added all possible questions with their answers so a user can help themselves. (also with a little bit of branding. ;))
